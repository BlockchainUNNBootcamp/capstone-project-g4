## Tech Used

React, Javascript and CSS

## Challenges and Solutions

Working with React was a tough one but along the way we had to give it our best by learning on how to use it.
Another challenges was pushing to our various branches on github, so our team lead had to host a meeting for us to be able to tackle it.

## Future plans

We'll keep exploring the field(tech), staying updated with the latest trends and technologies and also becoming full-stack developers and diving into the awesome world of web3(Blockchain) and AI/ML.
